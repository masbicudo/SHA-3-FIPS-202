# SHA-3-FIPS-202
I am trying to implement the SHA-3 (FIPS-202) hashing algorithm. Not finished yet, but this is a work in progress. The goal is to create a generator so that I can target multiple languages, but for now, i am implementing it in C#. Also, in the process of exploring this, I hope to create some useful tools.
